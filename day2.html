<h2><strike>Day 1</strike>  Day 2 - July 16th 2014</h2>

<body>

<p>Today is the first day of the rest of my life! Well, yesterday was. I've been sick for about three months at this point. Not deathly ill by any means, but uncomfortable, out of sorts, and pretty sedentary and solitary due to it. All of these things are bad. (I promise I'll stop bitching really soon and get to the good stuff.) Here's why it's particularly bad. I have a bad back (degenerative disk syndrome) and really need to be stretching daily and working out regularly to build core strength and make sure I don't reinjure myself. I also just recently lost about 30 pound and would prefer not to put it all back on. In fact, I have about another 20-30 pounds I would love to lose.
  </p>
<p>So now you have the background. Here's the turnaround point! I recently had an endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy (fun!) and am now waiting for the results. My doc also gave me a prescription for Nexium on my way out the door from that. Well, I've actually started to feel markedly better on the Nexium (I promise this isn't and ad).
  </p>
<p>Once I started feeling better, I decided it was time to pull it together; “it” being my life and myself. It's time to take back control! (See? It's getting motivational, right?(Just go with it.)) I know what you're thinking: "So Matt, what did you decide to do?" I'm glad you asked! I’m pretty sure that whatever has been wrong with me is food allergy related, so I decided to do what any sane person would do…cut everything possible out of my diet :) So this past weekend I did my food shopping and mental preparation and yesterday I started my Whole30.
  </p>
<p>What is a Whole30 you may be asking. The gist of it is that for 30 days you reboot your body and eat only things that contribute positively to your health, cutting out all inflammation causing food and unhealthy food. Basically, I’ve cut out all dairy, grains, legumes, sugar, soy, isolates and chemicals and have reduced my diet down to the most basic and healthy components possible. This is basically a really extreme version of paleo, but with a different core philosophy. I’m eating protein, fruits and vegetables. I’ll be trying to eat organic, pastured, grass-fed, wild caught, protein sources, but those so far seem to be cost prohibitive.
  </p>
<p>In addition to diet changes, I also need to get back to the gym and back to stretching. I can already feel my back weakening from just a couple of months of inactivity. So yesterday I signed up for a Fundamentals of Yoga Workshop, which I started this evening.
  </p>
<p>Day 1 of the Whole30 was pretty good. I didn't have much of a problem throughout the day and then got home and went on a cooking rampage. I made pretty much all of the food I had bought and was pretty satisfied with what I had eaten. Day 2 was a bit of a different story. My body started to reject the good decisions I was making and was really upset at me for not eating all of the crap I normally would.
